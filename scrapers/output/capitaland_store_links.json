Takahashi Kenichi, CEO of Japan Foods Holding, had worked to bring Afuri to Singapore since 2012. His vision was finally realised seven years later, with the launch of Afuri ramen + dumplings in Singapore.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfuri stands out from its competitors by making their signature ramen with yuzu, a small citrus fruit native to Asia. They are also crafted authentically to Japan\u2019s specification, producing ramen that is thin, light and refined. Afuri ramen are soaked in broth boiled with ingredients such as chicken, kombu and dried bonito. A dash of yuzu in the broth delivers a refreshing twist to the taste of the dish entirely. The pork slices that top the ramen are cooked over lava stones locally, as compared to being grilled with charcoal in Japan, yet the depth of the flavour is still preserved. For a satisfying side dish, opt for Afuri\u2019s dumplings that comes in a layer of crispy thin crust covering the bottom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfuri not only aims to share their passion for the process of producing quality and well-made food, but also to do their part in contributing to the community and so much more. Just as they are named after Mt. Afuri that stands steadfast and dependable, Afuri restaurant has one belief: \u201cOne ramen. One staff. Always Higher.\u201d So make your way to their outlet in Singapore today for a hot piping bowl of ramen!",

Since 2005, Astons has been providing great food at reasonable prices, carving its name and popularity into the hearts of locals who often patronise the causal dining establishment. They offer an extensive menu that utilises the freshest and best quality ingredients, providing a satisfying experience for everyone. For starters, the Cream of Mushroom Soup is a good option and it comes with a slice of toasted fragrant garlic bread to tantalise your appetite. Other than their popular Prime Ribeye that is juicy and cooked to your preferred doneness, the Chargrilled Chicken is also a fan favourite amongst Singaporeans. The chicken is succulent and perfectly grilled so that the charred parts bring out the taste of the chicken and paired with their sauce flavourfully. Another must try includes the Honey Bourbon Ribs which is slathered generously with BBQ sauce and so tender the meat slides right off the bones. Most main courses include 2 side dishes and there are other seafood and pasta options available in their menu as well.
